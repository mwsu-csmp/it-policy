#### Computer Availability and Priority of Use 
* Computers in back of the lab are available during regular hours on a first-come, first-served basis. Students who require access to this equipment in order to be able to access resources have priority. All decisions as to the use of the computers are at the discretion of the CSMP Faculty and Management.
#### Copyright and Licensing Restrictions 
* The user is responsible for observing all copyright laws. The software and documentation made available in the lab is for use only in the lab and is not to be duplicated for use elsewhere. Duplicating a copyrighted program or documentation is illegal and is an Honor Code violation.Terms of use are governed by individual subscriber agreements for each system.
#### Assumption of the Risk 
* The CSMP department and MWSU make no guarantee with respect to any equipment, programs, or other materials in the computer lab. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the computer equipment, programs, and documentation is with the user.

#### Reminders
* Remember to bring your own labelled storage media with you for storing any files you want to keep. It is wise to make a backup copy of any important files. Permanent file storage is not provided in the labs and files left on the computers are done so at your own risk.  
* Some software's are stored on the network server and only a certain number of copies can be used at one time. If you try to run a program and it is not available, then the maximum number of users has already been reached. Wait a short time and try again. Not all software provided in the labs is supported by IT. Supported software indicates that IT staff maintain the software and that questions may be directed to the IT Central consultants.
