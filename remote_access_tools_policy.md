# Remote Access Tools Policy

## Overview
Remote desktop software, also known as remote access tools, provide a way for computer users
and support staff alike to share screens, access work computer systems from home, and vice
versa. Examples of such software include LogMeIn, GoToMyPC, VNC (Virtual Network
Computing), and Windows Remote Desktop (RDP). While these tools can save significant time
and money by eliminating travel and enabling collaboration, they also provide a back door into
the <Company Name> network that can be used for theft of, unauthorized access to, or
destruction of assets. As a result, only approved, monitored, and properly controlled remote
access tools may be used on <Company Name> computer systems.

## Purpose
This policy defines the requirements for remote access tools used at <Company Name

## Scope
This policy applies to all remote access where either end of the communication terminates at a
<Company Name> computer asset

## Policy
All remote access tools used to communicate between <Company Name> assets and other
systems must comply with the following policy requirements.
## Remote Access Tools
<Company Name> provides mechanisms to collaborate between internal users, with external
partners, and from non-<Company Name> systems. The approved software list can be obtained
from <link-to-approved-remote-access-software-list>. Because proper configuration is
important for secure use of these tools, mandatory configuration procedures are provided for
each of the approved tools.
The approved software list may change at any time, but the following requirements will be used
for selecting approved products:
1. All remote access tools or systems that allow communication to <Company Name>
resources from the Internet or external partner systems must require multi-factor
authentication. Examples include authentication tokens and smart cards that require an
additional PIN or password.

2. The authentication database source must be Active Directory or LDAP, and the
authentication protocol must involve a challenge-response protocol that is not susceptible
to replay attacks. The remote access tool must mutually authenticate both ends of the
session.
3. Remote access tools must support the <Company Name> application layer proxy rather
than direct connections through the perimeter firewall(s).
4. Remote access tools must support strong, end-to-end encryption of the remote access
communication channels as specified in the <Company Name> network encryption
protocols policy.
5. All <Company Name> antivirus, data loss prevention, and other security systems must
not be disabled, interfered with, or circumvented in any way.
All remote access tools must be purchased through the standard <Company Name> procurement
process, and the information technology group must approve the purchase.
