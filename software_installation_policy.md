# Software Installation Policy

## Overview
Allowing employees and students to install software on company computing devices opens the organization
up to unnecessary exposure. Conflicting file versions or DLLs which can prevent programs
from running, the introduction of malware from infected installation software, unlicensed
software which could be discovered during audit, and programs which can be used to hack the
organization’s network are examples of the problems that can be introduced when employees
install software on company equipment.

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the requirements around installation software on
Phonix Lab computing devices. To minimize the risk of loss of program
functionality, the exposure of sensitive information contained within Missouri Western State University computing network, the risk of introducing malware, and the legal exposure of running unlicensed software.

## Scope
This policy applies to all Missouri Western State University employees and students. This policy covers all computers,
servers and other computing devices operating within Phonix Lab.

Technology department, unless no selection on the list meets the requester’s need.
* The Information Technology Department will obtain and track the licenses, test new
software for conflict and compatibility, and perform the installation.
