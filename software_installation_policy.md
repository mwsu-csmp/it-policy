# Software Installation Policy

## Overview
Allowing employees and students to install software on company computing devices opens the organization
up to unnecessary exposure. Conflicting file versions or DLLs which can prevent programs
from running, the introduction of malware from infected installation software, unlicensed
software which could be discovered during audit, and programs which can be used to hack the
organization’s network are examples of the problems that can be introduced when employees
install software on company equipment.

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the requirements around installation software on
Phonix Lab computing devices. To minimize the risk of loss of program
functionality, the exposure of sensitive information contained within Missouri Western State University computing network, the risk of introducing malware, and the legal exposure of running unlicensed software.

## Scope
This policy applies to all Missouri Western State University employees and students. This policy covers all computers,
servers and other computing devices operating within Phonix Lab.

## Policy
### Software purchase and acquisition
* University software must be purchased in accordance with the university's financial regulations and with the rules and procedures for purchasing and acquiring software. These include prior approval of proposed software purchases and acquisitions by IT Help Desk so that technical, licensing, support, and value for money issues can be considered.
### Permitted use of University software
* Unless explicitly authorised, all university software is only for academic or research use, or for the purposes of the university's business and administration, and not for consultancy work. Before using university software for consultancy or other external work, users must contact IT Help Desk to check whether such use is permitted and, if so, what acknowledgements must be included. Similarly university software must not be used by placement students for the benefit of their employers.
### Software Requirements
* It is the responsibility of the requestor to determine if the application will run on the destination computer before purchasing.  The IT Help Desk has resources to help determine if the destination computer has the adequate resources to run the application and can offer suggestions of software for various functions as well.
### Software installations
* Software must only be installed on university computers or networks if there are the appropriate licences, and if its use is in accordance with its licensing rules. By default end users are prohibited from installing software on university computers - requests for installation must be placed via the IT Service Desk
* Academic or administrative software applications which will require installation on, or distribution via the university's servers and networks, must not be purchased or acquired without prior technical discussion, evaluation and agreement with IT Help Desk.
* Software requests must first be approved by the requester’s manager and then be made
to the Help Desk in writing or via email.
* Software must be selected from an approved software list, maintained by the Information
Technology department, unless no selection on the list meets the requester’s need.
* The Information Technology Department will obtain and track the licenses, test new
software for conflict and compatibility, and perform the installation.
### System Set Up and Configuration
* The IT Help Desk is responsible for the setup and configuration of all Phonix Lab Systems ((i.e., Network Servers, Research and Training Servers and Desktop Computers).
### Root Access/ System Security
Access to root or administrative privileges on Phonix machines is controlled by the “sudo” command (Macintosh, LINUX and UNIX systems) or by adding users to administrative groups (Windows and Macintosh systems).  Using commands such as “sudo” or assigning users to privileged groups is useful for the following reasons.
#### Privileged access is allowed for the following people:
*	Faculty staff to perform system administration tasks on all Phonix computers.
*	All faculty members are allowed to have privileged access on their Personal Computers and Area Research Servers.
*	The IT Help Desk is responsible for approving requests for privileged access. Faculty and/or staff members responsible for the computer system will agree to the mechanisms and policies governing privileged access.
#### Privileged access requires the following:
*	On LINUX/UNIX systems do not use the sudo command to run a shell (e.g., “sudo bash”) unless there is no other alternative.  Continue using the “sudo” command if you have started a root shell.
*	Do not use privileged access to log on to a system as another user unless you have first received permission from the user.
*	Report system changes to the IT Help Desk.  IT Help Desk will work diligently to restore a user’s system in the event of a system failure; however, if the system has been highly modified and the IT Help Desk was not aware of the changes made to the system, then the only option may be to reinstall the host operating system from the standard system image.
*	Those persons granted privileged access to work on a Phonix Lab machine must consult with the IT Help Desk before making system level changes.
*	Do not change the root password on system.
*	Do not install software or activate system services that are listed on the insecure software.
*	All systems on which faculty and staff have administrative privileges must maintain a IT Help Desk privileged account.  If the IT Help Desk privileged account is used interactively, the owner of the computer will be contacted by IT Help Desk as soon as possible.  Those using the IT Help Desk privileged accounts will use the sudo command whenever executing privileged commands.  IT Help Desk will consult with the owner of the computer before making major system changes.
*	All systems on which faculty and staff have administrative privileges may be periodically scanned for insecure software and servicesFailure to follow these guidelines may result in the loss of privileged access and/or the computer being denied access to basic network services (e.g., printing and NFS to the main file server).
### Versions of software
* Normally only the current version of a software application and its immediate predecessor will be implemented and supported. In some cases technical, support or licensing issues may preclude more than one version being available.
### Copying of software, media and manuals
* Software must not be copied from one computer to another, or copies made of software media or manuals, without explicit confirmation from IT Help Desk that this is in accordance with the appropriate licensing agreements and with copyright law.
### Disposals of software
* University software licences must not be given away or sold for use outside the university. All software on university computers which are being disposed of must be securely destroyed or uninstalled. The media and licensing keys for software which is being permanently withdrawn from use must be destroyed.
### Departing staff and students
* Staff and students who leave the university and who have had university software (and/or data) installed on computers owned by them, must remove all such software and data immediately.
## Policy Compliance
### Exceptions
Any exception to the policy must be approved by the IT Help Desk team in advance.
### Non-Compliance
* An employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment.
* A student found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplonary action, up to suspension.
